# Bash practice

## About

This repository exists primarily to house my experiments with Bash, largely comprised of exercises for the course "Shell Scripting: Discover How to Automate Command Line Tasks" on Udemy.

## Extra-Curricular Dabblings

Scripts not part of exercises for the Udemy course will reside in directories not beginning with "`section_`" followed by the section number, and those directories will be listed below.

- `expect` - Working with the Expect utility to learn how to automate certain deployment tasks.
